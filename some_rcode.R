#dplyr::na_if(x, y) replaces NA values in `x` with `y`
# it works when x is a data.frame _without_ Date objects, but fails when there is a Date in the df
# Can you use our debugging tools to figure out where and why it is failing?

  a = lubridate::today() + runif(5) * 30,

# The traceback is easier to understand without the pipe involved

#na_if(test,"")

# Also useful to look at the implementation of `na_if()`
# Can you reproduce the error without using `na_if()`?

# What happens if you remove the date column from the tibble?

# How could you apply na_if only to non-date columns?
